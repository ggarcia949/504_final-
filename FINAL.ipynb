    "## Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and supply-chain related delays, profit and customer analysis is critical in the realm of E-commerce. The Global Superstore dataset contains 51290 rows of transaction data including customer, shipping, order, profit, and location information. Our goal, at a high level, was to explore this information and recommend actionable changes to improve aspects of the company. More specifically, our team focused on profit associated with products. With a dataset this complex, correlation between product and profit is not as straightforward as one may assume. Products have differing profit margins, in addition to purchase frequency, holding cost, shipping options, and wholesale order reliability. Our team took a machine learning approach to this problem by training predictive models to predict profitability of products in relation to the details surrounding each order. These models, which will be described in detail throughout this report, give Global Superstore the ability to choose which orders to fulfill to maximize their profit margins. "

To find if a product is worth selling, predictive models were built and tested based on predictive accuracy. Those models with initial accuracy worth exploring were tuned via hyper parameter tuning to improve predictive performance. Ultimately, our team decided to move forward with CHOSEN MODEL, based on it's performance and interpretability. The use of predictive modeling in this application will help stakeholders decide if future product opportunites are likely to bring in a profit or loss in revenue. "
